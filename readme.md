As of React 0.14, xlink:href is available via React as the property xlinkHref. It is mentioned as one of the "notable enhancements" in the release notes for 0.14.

<!-- REACT JSX: -->
<svg>
  <use xlinkHref='/svg/svg-sprite#my-icon' />
</svg>

<!-- RENDERS AS: -->
<svg>
  <use xlink:href="/svg/svg-sprite#my-icon"></use>
